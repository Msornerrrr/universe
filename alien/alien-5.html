	<h2> The Fifth Alien in the Universe? </h2>
	<p> For now, it's impossible to imagine how alien lives look like </p>
	<p> They may be an entirely different form of live </p>
	<p> Are they carbon based? Do they have DNA, or other genetic models? How's there way of reasoning, communicating, etc...? </p>
	<p> There are so many unknowns that human need to explore </p>
	<p> If aliens were really found in the universe, it would dramatically affects our definition for lives </p>
