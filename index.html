	<h2> Basic Science </h2>
		<h3> Speed of Light </h3>
		<hr>
		<p> The speed of light is: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> 299,792,458 m/s </li>
			<li> 1079252812.8 km/h </li>
			<li> 670616607.01503 mph </li>
		</ul>
		<p> You need to know: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> It takes 13.5 hours from Beijing to Los Angeles by airplane </li>
			<li> Light can go around the earth seven times per second </li>
			<li> It takes 1 second for light to travel from the moon to the earth; so the moonnlight we see is always 1 second ago </li>
			<li> It takes eight minutes and twenty seconds for light to travel from the sun to the earth; so the sunlight we see is always 8 minutes ago </li>
			<li> It takes millions of years for light to travel from other stars to the earth; so the stars we see are probably million of years ago. Some stars may have already passed away </li>
		</ul>

		<h3> The Universe is Large </h3>
		<hr>
		<p> Light-year: the distance that light travels in vacuum in one year. We use light-year to measure distance that are extremely large in the scale of the universe  </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Moon is <strong> 1 light-second </strong> away from the earth </li>
			<li> Solar is <strong> 8.3 light-minute </strong> away from the earth </li>
			<li> Neptune (the farest planets of solor system) is <strong> 4 light-hour </strong> away from the sun </li>
			<li> The nearest star to our solor system is <strong> 4.22 light-year </strong> away from us </li>
			<li> The width of our galaxy is <strong> 100,000 - 180,000 light-year </strong> </li>
			<li> The observable universe has a radius of <strong> 46508000000 light-year </strong> </li>
		</ul>

	<h2> The Solar System </h2>
	<h3> Intro </h3>
	<hr>
	<p> Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. </p>
	<p> Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€“ the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way. </p>

	<h3> Formation </h3>
	<hr>
	<p> Our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula â€“ a spinning, swirling disk of material. </p>

	<p> At the center, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually, the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99% of the available matter. </p>

	<p> Matter farther out in the disk was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets, and large moons. In other cases, planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite come together into a planet. Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons. </p>

	<h3> Numbers </h3>
	<hr>
	<ul>
		<li> Number of Stars: 1 </li>
		<li> Known Planets: 8 </li>
		<li> Known Dwart Planets: 9 </li>
		<li> Known Natural Satellites: 575 </li>
		<li> Known Comets: 4,143 </li>
	</ul>
